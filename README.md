## Game Ranking Algorithm

The aim of the ranking system is to assign value to a game based on 'watchability' or 'excitment'. This is hard for numbers alone to achieve but we've given it a go (and open it ideas). Current methodology follows the below basic formula:

```
Number of overtimes x 'Overtime Value' (default: 3) +
'Final Margin Value' - Final game margin + 
Individual player highest points scored x 'Top Player Points Value' (default: 0.1) +
Team highest points scored - 100 x 'Top Team Points Value' (default: 0.1)
```

There are two final score adjustments possible, which can both be utilised at the same time.

1) **Win Percentages:** Multiply final *'Game Rank'* score by the sum of the win percentages of the competing teams.
For example, two teams above .500 will increase the total *'Game Rank'* score
2) **Nightly Margin:** Rather than using an arbitrary value for the *'Final Margin Value'*, replace it with the maximum margin for the night.
